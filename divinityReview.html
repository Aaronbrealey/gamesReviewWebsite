            <p style="font-size: 16pt">Some rats won't listen to reason. Just the other day, I met one at the top of a flight of stairs who asked me if the zombie-like creatures crucified below us were any danger to him, and I assured him they most certainly were. But the punk got it in his little rodent brain that I was lying for my own gain, so he tried to charge past them to the wharf beyond… and got fried by lightning that the husks vomited from their mouths. Toldja, little guy. I'd always figured being able to talk to animals would open doors to deep wisdom, but if similar interactions in Divinity: Original Sin 2 prove anything, they're just as foolish as we are.<br>
            <br>Moments like these are a big part of the reason why I love Larian Studios' new adventure so much. It's one of the finest RPGs of any variety in years, especially if you're a fan of the old isometric Baldur's Gate model that defined the genre in the early '90s. But inspired imitation isn't the chief goal here, as in the somewhat similar (and also excellent) Pillars of Eternity from Obsidian. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a masterwork that radiates excellence in every aspect, whether we're talking about its broad commitment to character choice and rewarding combat or the little interactions, like my chat with the rat, that make its fantasy world feel both properly "fantastic" and believable.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 16pt">Don't get the impression that it's all about conversations with rodents. This is a proper Great Adventure, packed with high-fantasy hijinks affecting the whole world, but it happily deals less with Tolkienian absolutes and more with the nuanced, morally gray areas that make the universes of Dragon Age and Game of Thrones so appealing. Original Sin 2 has important things to say about marginalization and exclusion, focusing as it does on so-called "sourcerers" whom the rest of the world clamps with magic collars that protect others from the abilities that set them apart. If you’re new, you don’t have to worry about missing out on all the lore from the first Original Sin from 2014. The sequel takes places centuries later when the settings and characters of the first game have slipped into legend, and it stands fine on the strength of its own tale.You're encouraged to hunt for sidequests in the strangest places.<br>
            <br>The tale itself achieves a commendable balance of gravitas and lightheartedness that was sometimes missing in the first Divinity: Original Sin. It's richly written, too, with everything from the descriptions of the narrator to the most custom responses for specific races or characters being fully voiced. This quality extends even to the side quests, which stand out not only for their writing but also for how they're found. As with so many things in this world, Original Sin 2 encourages you to experiment and hunt for them in the strangest places as they're unmarked by the garish bluntness of a yellow exclamation point hovering over an NPC's head. Sometimes you'll find a ghostly knight who's been magically impaled for centuries by playing hide-and-seek with some kid you clicked on out of curiosity.</p>

            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 16pt">It doesn't hurt that Original Sin 2 is as graphically beautiful as any game of this perspective has ever been. Everything on the screen speaks of attention to loving detail and thoughtful placement, whether it's the arrangement of flora on a sandy beach or the animations of a winter dragon thankful for being released from its chains. It's beautiful in other ways, too, though, such as how little stories spring from items and NPCs that other games might be content to leave as part of the scenery. Talking to a random character might lead to tales of sad memories that have no bearing on the plot but are no less stirring and rewarding for that fact. Animals, as mentioned, often give a different perspective on what's going on if you have the "Pet Pal" perk that lets you talk to them. Turning over every rock and slip of paper just to find these small wonders is one of the best parts of Original Sin 2.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 16pt">Among the many great things about Original Sin 2 is the inclusion of a "Game Master" mode that lets you guide custom scenarios with friends in real-time much like a pencil-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master, thus allowing for fun and replayability long after you've completed the main story. But I found that the volatility of the normal campaign co-op mode allows for much of the same unpredictability that makes tabletop D&D so fun, although, as with any game that requires a unified, coordinated team for success, you're likely going to have a better time if you play co-op with friends you trust rather than some randos in the lobby.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 16pt">Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur’s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it. Few other RPGs allow such a wide range of flexibility while also supporting rewarding combat and a powerful story, all in a world that feels alive in the ways it reacts to you and goes about its business without you. It's a rare RPG that I’ll want to play through again and again, driven by the feeling that so many fascinating and surprising paths remain undiscovered, some of which might lead to different outcomes for the NPCs I’ve grown to care about – even the rats. When that happens, you're experiencing something worth remembering, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be remembered as one of the greats.</p>
